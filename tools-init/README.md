# Tools Init

A Bash script for quickly setting up essential developer tools and configurations on a new Debian/Ubuntu server.

## Features

- Updates the system packages to the latest versions
- Installs common developer tools (vim-nox, docker.io, bat, lsd)
- Configures useful system-wide and user-specific aliases
- Adds productivity-enhancing shell functions
- Sets up Docker service to run at boot
- Applies configurations to the current session

## Requirements

- Debian-based Linux distribution (Ubuntu, Debian, etc.)
- Root privileges to run the script

## Installed Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| vim-nox | Enhanced version of Vim with additional features |
| docker.io | Container platform for building and running applications |
| bat | Modern replacement for `cat` with syntax highlighting |
| lsd | Modern replacement for `ls` with icons and colors |

## Configured Aliases and Functions

| Name | Type | Command/Action | Scope |
|------|------|---------------|-------|
| upgrade | Alias | `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y` | System-wide |
| cat | Alias | `/usr/bin/batcat` | User-specific |
| ls | Alias | `/usr/bin/lsd` | User-specific |
| mkcd | Function | Creates a directory and changes into it | User-specific |

## Usage

1. Download the script:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arduriki/devops-bash-scripts/main/tools-init/tools-init.sh
```

2. Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x tools-init.sh
```

3. Run the script with root privileges
```bash
sudo ./tools-init.sh
```

4. The script will:
- Update and upgrade all system packages
- Install the specified developer tools
- Configure aliases for easier system management
- Add productivity-enhancing shell functions
- Enable and start Docker service
- Apply bash configuration changes to the current session

## Custom Functions
### mkcd
Creates a directory and immediately changes into it.
Usage:
```bash
mkcd new_project_directory
```
This will create "new_project_directory" and change into it in one command.

## Example Output
```bash

## Customization
You can easily customize this script to include additional tools or configurations:
- Add more packages to the apt install line
- Configure additional aliases in the /etc/bash.bashrc section
- Add more shell functions to increase productivity
- Add more services to enable at boot

## Notes
- Tool-specific aliases are only created if the tools are installed successfully.
- The script must be run as root to install packages and configure system-wide settings.
